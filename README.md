# AmeisenBotX

Hopefully the last rewrite of my WoW bot. I've learned much during the other 2 attempts so i decided to rewrite it from scratch. The aim of this bot is to create a human like group player that assists you on your adventure. From managing it's equipment to gathering resources the bot should do anything on its own.
